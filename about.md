Neuroinformatics is an emerging field of research that comprises the use of
modern data-intensive technologies in neuroscience. Its practice requires both
broad knowledge of neuroscience as well as substantive competency in data
science. The neuroinformatics special interses group at the University of Washington (UW)
[eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/) and the University of
Washington [Institute for Neuroengineering (UWIN)](http://uwin.washington.edu/)
focuses on neuroinformatics methods and their role in understanding the brain.

During the Fall quarter 2018, we will meet every other week on 
Tuesday (starting October 2nd) at 1 PM in 
[the Center for Computational Neuroscience](http://compneuro.washington.edu/), 
which is located in 
[room G-207 in the Health Sciences Building](http://compneuro.washington.edu/wordpress/contact/).  

To join the group, and receive information about the meetings, please sign up to the [mailing list](https://mailman12.u.washington.edu/mailman/listinfo/neuroinformatics).
